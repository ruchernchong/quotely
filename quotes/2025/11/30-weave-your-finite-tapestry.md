> Behold the swift river of moments, each drop a jewel vanishing downstream. Do not merely watch its flow, but dive into its current, feeling the rush of now. Your breath, a delicate bloom, wilts in time, yet its fragrance can linger through purposeful deeds. Let urgency be your gentle guide, not a harsh master. Sow seeds of kindness, harvest wisdom, and sculpt your transient days into a masterpiece. For the sundial's shadow whispers a truth: this precious, fleeting span is your grand stage, not a waiting room. Make every beat of your heart a resonant note in life's brief, beautiful symphony.
