> Forget the tired sermons on grind and conformity. True discipline isn't about fitting into a predetermined mold; it's the radical act of consistently sculpting your own damn destiny, even when the world demands you stay soft. Consistency isn't mindless repetition; it's the relentless, defiant application of your unique vision, day in and day out, ignoring the comfortable siren song of mediocrity. Don't seek permission to build your empire; simply show up, again and again, with an unwavering, rebellious spirit. This isn't obedience; it's ownership.
