> A wise elder once shared, Observe the river. It carves canyons, not with sudden fury, but with relentless, gentle persistence over ages. This quiet power mirrors true learning. Wisdom is not grasped in a rush, but nurtured through steady curiosity, soft contemplation, and the open embrace of each new experience. Allow understanding to flow through you, shaping your spirit with grace, much like the water shapes stone, patiently, beautifully, and forever deepening its path.
