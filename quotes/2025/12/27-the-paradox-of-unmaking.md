> To truly become, you must first unravel. This isn't a gentle unfolding, but a necessary shattering of the familiar, a dismantling of the self you thought was fixed.

It is in the stark, uncomfortable void between what was and what will be that genuine transformation takes root. Find your certainty in the shifting sands, your stability in the constant flux. For only by breaking apart can you truly reassemble into something authentically new, a form forged by both ruin and relentless becoming.
