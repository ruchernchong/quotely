> Cease merely existing. Demand more from your vessel. Command every choice: what fuels your cells, how you sculpt your strength, and when you reclaim your peace. Your body is not a fragile thing, but a powerful instrument. Sharpen its edges daily with discipline. Fuel it with intention. Let vitality surge, not as a fleeting gift, but as the raw power you fiercely cultivate. Master this lifeforce; it is your imperative.
