> Leadership isn't about the echo of your command, but the resonance of your conviction. It's not the weight of your title that moves mountains, but the gravitational pull of your purpose. A true leader doesn't merely point the way; they become the compass in the storm, challenging complacent minds to chart unknown territories. While management dictates the pace, influence cultivates a shared hunger for progress, turning skeptics into architects of a bold new reality. Choose to inspire a movement, not just manage a workforce; genuine influence lasts generations, power merely fades.
