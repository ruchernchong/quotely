> Forget the comfort of 'knowing'. True wisdom isn't a collection of facts, but a relentless excavation of your own ignorance. Challenge every conviction, every received truth, and especially every belief you hold dear. If your learning doesn't provoke discomfort, if it doesn't dismantle a long-held certainty, you're merely decorating your echo chamber, not expanding your mind. Stop seeking affirmation; start seeking the cracks in your understanding. That's where genuine insight resides, born from the courageous act of admitting how much you still need to unlearn.
