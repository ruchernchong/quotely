> Notice the gentle tremor that fear brings, not as a wall, but a tender guide. It points to where your spirit yearns to grow. Instead of pushing it away, softly invite it in. Listen to what it teaches about your vulnerability, for within that delicate space, courage is born, not with a roar, but with a quiet, persistent whisper of your own resilience. Your strength isn't the absence of fear, but the loving presence you offer yourself through it.
