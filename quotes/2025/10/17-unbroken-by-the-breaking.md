> Let the world shatter around you, for it is in the fragments that true resilience finds its form. Embrace the very collapse that threatens to undo you, for only by losing your footing can you truly learn the art of unwavering balance. Your deepest resolve is not found in avoiding the storm, but in standing naked within its fiercest winds, learning to bend without breaking. Command the chaos; let the discomfort be your forge, shaping an unbreakable spirit. Understand that the greatest strength is not the absence of pain, but the capacity to be profoundly wounded and yet relentlessly rise, again and again, becoming whole precisely by being broken.
