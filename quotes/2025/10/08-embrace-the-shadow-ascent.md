> Imagine fear not as a towering wall, but as a dense, mist-shrouded forest path. Each step into the unknown feels cold and uncertain, yet with every gentle push forward, a sliver of sunlight piercing the canopy. The rustle of leaves isn't always a warning; often, it's the wind whispering tales of paths once feared, now traversed. Courage isn't the absence of this mist, but the unwavering choice to breathe in its chill and continue walking, knowing the most breathtaking vistas are often revealed just beyond the thickest fog. Let your heart be the compass, guiding you towards your true north.
