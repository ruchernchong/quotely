> Imagine a seasoned guide leading a seeker through a dense forest. The guide doesn't point to distant peaks or recount past trails. Instead, they command: Feel the earth beneath your feet. Breathe the air of this very instant. Observe the light filtering through these leaves, now. For true power isn't in what was, or what will be, but in the unwavering mastery of the single, unfolding present. This is where your strength resides.
