> We often lament the distance between us, the perceived failures of others to meet us halfway. But have you truly examined the architecture of your own outreach? Is your bridge to another built of genuine curiosity and vulnerability, or merely a projection of your needs? Connection isn't something granted; it's meticulously constructed, first within your own readiness to truly see and be seen, stripped of expectations. Perhaps the void isn't in the other, but in the unexamined spaces within you that resist authentic encounter. Challenge yourself to dismantle your own barriers before pointing to the walls in their garden. True intimacy begins when you dare to excavate your own foundations.
