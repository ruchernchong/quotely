> Many merely drift through existence, reacting to life rather than defining it, content to be carried by the current. They mistake consumption for contribution, and passive hope for audacious intent. Meaning is not discovered; it is declared. Purpose is not found in what you take, but in what you passionately build and boldly offer. The challenge isn't to fill your time, but to infuse it with unyielding significance. Are you just occupying space, or forging your indelible mark on the world?
