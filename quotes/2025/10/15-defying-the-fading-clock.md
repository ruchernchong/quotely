> Do not let the ticking of the cosmic clock dictate your surrender. My mortality is not a gentle current to be passively ridden but a fierce, finite energy demanding to be spent, not saved. This singular existence is a canvas for audacious strokes, not cautious dabs. Let others whisper of eternity; I choose to scream my truth in this precious, passing moment. There is no rehearsal for this wild ride, no second act to perfect. Own the brevity, ignite the now, and forge a legacy not of lasting stone, but of unyielding, incandescent spirit.
