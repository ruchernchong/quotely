> Imagine a shadowed forest, thick with the echoes of your deepest doubts. A beast, born of fear, lurks within the trees. You could turn back, escape its unseen gaze. But what if you took one step forward, then another? Not to fight it, but to simply acknowledge its presence. The monster shrinks not from your sword, but from the light of your unwavering steps. Courage isn't the absence of fear; it's the quiet decision to walk through the shadowed woods, knowing the beast is there, and still choosing your path.
