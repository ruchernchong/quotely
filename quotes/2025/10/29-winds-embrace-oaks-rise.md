> A young sapling, buffeted by relentless gales, did not break. Instead, it learned to sway, allowing the wind to shape its form, its roots anchoring deeper with each storm. It didn't fight the force; it adapted. Years later, it stood as a resilient oak, every bend in its trunk a testament to its enduring spirit. We, too, grow strongest not by avoiding the winds of change, but by learning to move with them.
