> A blacksmith doesn't see a warped piece of metal as failure, but another strike. Each bend that doesn't hold, each crack, isn't wasted. It's the brutal, honest truth of the material, revealing limits, guiding the next, precise impact. Your missteps aren't final breaks. They are fiery lessons, intense pressures tempering your spirit, revealing true strength, shaping you into something far more resilient. Keep striking. Keep forging.
